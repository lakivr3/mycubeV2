          Ever since we saw the Rubik's cube for the first time, we were
          mesmerized by it and we didn't rest until we solved it. We are crazy
          about puzzles, and we strive to give you all access to the latest fun,
          original, silly and unusual 2, 3 and more layered puzzles and rubik's
          cubes.
